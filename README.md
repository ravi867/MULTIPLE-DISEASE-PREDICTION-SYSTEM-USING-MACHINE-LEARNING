Multiple Disease Prediction System
This project aims to create a web application that predicts the likelihood of three diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. It utilizes machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Classifiers (SVC), to analyze user-provided data and provide risk estimates.

Technologies Used:
Python: General-purpose programming language
Streamlit: Python library for building web apps
Scikit-learn: Python library for machine learning
Pandas: Python library for data analysis
NumPy: Python library for mathematical operations
Features:
User-friendly web interface for data input and prediction results.
Implementation of SVM and SVC algorithms for disease prediction.
Prediction of three diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease.
Provides risk estimates for each disease based on user data.
Data visualization for insights into user data and model performance.
Installation:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
Install the required dependencies:
pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas numpy
Download pre-trained models (if provided) and place them in the appropriate directory.
Run the application:
streamlit run app.py
Usage:
Open the web application URL in your browser.
Enter the requested user data, including medical history, lifestyle factors, and other relevant information.
Click the "Predict" button.
The application will display the predicted risk of each disease based on the user data and the trained models.
Analyze the data visualizations provided for further insights.
Future Improvements:
Train models on a larger dataset for improved accuracy.
Integrate additional disease prediction models.
Implement advanced data preprocessing techniques.
Include feature importance analysis for user data.
Develop a secure user authentication system.
